	<h1 id="top" align="middle">Looking at how other Sites are built</h1>
	<p>When the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and
		techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.</p>
	<p>These days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code
		that a web server sends to you. To try this out for yourself, simply go to the sample code for this chapter, at
		www.htmlandcssbook.com/ code/ and click on the link called "View Source."</p>
	<p>Once you have opened this page, you can look for the View menu in your browser, and select the option that says
		Source or View source. (The title changes depending on what browser you are using.)
	</p>
	<p>You should see a new window appear, and it will contain the source code that was used to create this page.
	</p>
	<p>You can see this result in the photograph on the right. The page you see is the window at the top; the code is
		below.
	</p>
	<p>At first this code might look complicated but don't be discouraged. By the time you have finished the next
		chapter of this book, you will be able to understand it. </p>
	<p>All of the examples for this book are on the website, and you can use this simple technique on any of the example
		pages to see how they work.</p>
	<p>You can also download all of the code for this book from the same website by clicking on the "Download" link.

	<h3>Covid-19</h3>
	<img src="../static/img/covid-19.jpg" alt="Two Womens wearing a mask" title="COVID-19" width="1333" height="640">
	<p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
			water.
			Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on
			your hands.</li>
		<li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs,
			sneezes,
			or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are
			too
			close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.</li>
		<li>Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come
			into
			close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1
			metre (3 feet).</li>
		<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
			contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter
			your
			body and infect you.</li>
		<li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your
			mouth
			and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
			immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you
			protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
		<li>Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you
			recover.
			Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others.
			Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.</li>

	<h2>Class Attribute</h2>

	<!-- Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites.

To do this you can use the class attribute. Its value should describe the class it belongs to. In the example on the left, key paragraphs have a class attribute whose value is important.

The class attribute on any element can share the same value. So, in this example, the value of important could be used on headings and links, too.
 -->

	<p class="important">For a one-year period from November 2010, the Marugame Genichiro-Inokuma Museum of
		Contemporary
		Art (MIMOCA) will host a cycle of four Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibitions</p>

		"Architecture,"

	<h2>Grouping Text & Elements in a block</h2>
	<div id="header">
		<!-- The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

For example, you might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a <div> element to contain comments from visitors.

In a browser, the contents of the <div> element will start on a new line, but other than this it will make no difference to the presentation of the page.

Using an id or class attribute on the <div> element, however, means that you can create CSS style rules to indicate how much space the <div> element should occupy on the screen and change the appearance of all the elements contained within it.

It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used <div> elements to hold each section of the page.

	<h2>Grouping Text & Element Inline</h2>
	<!-- 
The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. It is used to either: 
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline elements
The most common reason why people use <span> elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.
You will usually see that a class or id attribute is used with <span> elements:
‚óè To explain the purpose of this <span> element
‚óè So that CSS styles can be applied to elements that have specific values for these attributes

	<h1>Text</h1>
	<h2>Size Of Type</h2>
	<h3>There are three type of values to write under font Size</h3>
	<ul style="font-family: cursive;">
		<li style="font-size: 20px;"><u><i><b>Pixels</b></i></u> - Pixels are commonly used because they allow web
			designers very precise control
			over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px.</li>
		<li style="font-size: 125%;"><u><i><b>Percentages</b></i></u> - The default size of text in browsers is
			16px. So
			a size of 75% would be
			the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px. If you create a rule to make all text inside the 'body'
			element to be 75% of the default size (to make it 12px), and then specify another rule that indicates
			the
			content of an element inside the 'body' element should be 75% size, it will be 9px (75% of the 12px font
			size).</li>
		<li style="font-size: 1.4em;"><u><i><b>EMS</b></i></u> - An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m.
		</li>
		<li style="font-size: 15pt;"><u><i><b>Points</b></i></u> - Print designers often refer to the size of text
			in
			terms of points rather than
			pixels (hence the use of pt in the scale on the right). A pixel roughly equates to a point because a
			point
			corresponds to 1/72 of an inch, and most computer displays have a resolution of 72 dots per inch.</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="../static/img/type size.png" alt="..." title="Type Size">

	<h2>More Font Choice</h2>
	<p class="this">@font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person
		browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on
		the user's machine.
		<br>Because this technique allows a version of the font to be downloaded to the user's computer, it is
		important that the license for the font permits it to be used in this way.
		<br>You add the font to your style sheet using the @font-face rule, as shown on the right. </p>

	<h2>Font Weight - Bold</h2>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">This is bold</p>

	<h2>Font Style - Italic</h2>
	<p style="font-style: italic;">This is italic</p>

	<h2>Text transformation - uppercase and lowercase</h2>
	<p style="text-transform: uppercase;">this is uppercase</p>
	<p style="text-transform: lowercase;">this is lowercase</p>

	<h2>Text - Alignment (Horizontally)</h2>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Left - This indicates that the text should be left-aligned.</p>
	<p style="text-align: right;">Right - This indicates that the text should be right-aligned.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">Center - This allows you to center text.</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">Justify - This indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line,
		should be set to take up the full width of the containing box.</p>

	<h2>Text - Alignment (Vertically)</h2>
	<!-- 
The vertical-align property is a common source of confusion. It is not intended to allow you to vertically align text in the middle of block level elements such as <p> and <div>, although it does have this effect when used with table cells (the <td> and <th> elements).
It is more commonly used with inline elements such as <img>, <em>, or <strong> elements. When used with these elements,  it performs a task very similar to the HTML align attribute used on the <img> element, which you met on pages 103-106. The values it can take are:
baseline, sub, super, top, text-top, middle, bottom, text-bottom
It can also take a length (usually specified in pixels or ems) or a percentage of the line height.

	<h2>Text Indent</h2>
	<!-- 
The text-indent property allows you to indent the first line of text within an element. The amount you want the line indented by can be specified in a number of ways but is usually given in pixels or ems.
It can take a negative value, which means it can be used to push text off the browser window. You can see this technique used in this example, where the <h1> element uses a background image to represent the heading. The text has been moved far to the left, off the screen. 
We still want the heading text to be on the page (for search engines and those who cannot see the image), but we cannot have it displayed on top of the logo or it will be unreadable. By pushing it 9,999 pixels to the left, it is way out of sight but still in the HTML code.
The second rule in this example indents the credits 20 pixels to the right.
 -->
	<p id="two-text-indent">This sentence contains text-indent</p>

	<h2>Drop Shadow</h2>
	<!-- The text-shadow property has become commonly used despite lacking support in all browsers. 
It is used to create a drop shadow, which is a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly offset. It can also be used to create an embossed effect by adding a shadow that is slightly lighter than the text.
The value of this property is quite complicated because it can take three lengths and a color for the drop shadow. 
The first length indicates how far to the left or right the shadow should fall.
The second value indicates the distance to the top or bottom that the shadow should fall.
The third value is optional and specifies the amount of blur that should be applied to the drop shadow.
The fourth value is the color of the drop shadow.

	<p style="text-align: justify;">:hover - This is applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device
		such as a mouse. This has
		commonly been used to change the appearance of links and buttons when a user places their cursor over them. It
		is worth noting that such events do not work on devices that use touch screens (such as the iPad) because the
		screen is not able to tell when someone is hovering their finger over an element.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">:active - This is applied when an element is being activated by a user; for example,
		when a button is being
		pressed or a link being clicked. Sometimes this is used to make a button or link feel more like it is being
		pressed by changing the style or position of the element slightly.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">:focus - This is applied when an element has focus. Any element that you can
		interact with, such as a link you can
		click on or any form control can have focus.
		responding To users :hover, :active, :focus
		Focus occurs when a browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an element on the page. For example,
		when your cursor is in a form input ready to accept typing, that element is said to have focus. It is also
		possible to use the tab key on your keyboard to move through the interactive items on a page. When
		pseudo-classes are used, they should appear in this order: :link, :visited, :hover, :focus, :active.

		In order to center a box on the page, you need to set a width for the box (otherwise it will take up the full
		width of the page). <br>
		Once you have specified the width of the box, setting the left and right margins to auto will make the browser
		put an equal gap on each side of the box. This centers the box on the page (or within the element that the box
		sits inside). <br>
		In order for this to work in older browsers (particularly IE6), the element that the box sits inside should have
		a text-align property with its value set to center. <br>
		The text-align property is inherited by child elements. You therefore also need to specify the text-align
		property on the centered box if you do not want the text inside it to be centered. <br>

	<p>To create more complex shapes, you can specify different distances for the horizontal and the vertical parts of

		You can target just one corner using the individual properties for that corner: <br>
		border-top-left-radius: 80px 50px; <br>
		There is also a shorthand for targetting all four corners at once; first you specify the four horizontal values,
		then the four vertical values, as shown in the second shape on the left. <br>
		You can even create a circle by taking a square box and making the border-radius the same height as the square,
		as shown in the third shape on the left.

		<p>This include:-<b>width</b> to set the width of the table <b>,</b>
			<b>padding</b> to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content <b>,</b>
			<b>text-transform</b> to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase <b>,</b>
			<b>letter-spacing, font-size</b> to add additional styling to the content of the table headers <b>,</b>
			<b>border-top, border-bottom</b> to set borders above and below the table headers <b>,</b>
			<b>text-align</b> to align the writing to the left of some table cells and to the right of the others

			<b>background-color</b> to change the background color of the alternating table rows <b>,</b>
			<b>:hover</b> to highlight a table row when a user's mouse goes over it <b>,</b>
			<br><br>
			<b>There are some tips for styling tables:-</b> <br>
			<b>Give cells Padding</b>: If the text in a table cell either touches a border (or another cell), it becomes
			much harder to read. Adding padding helps to improve readability.
			<b>Distinguish Headings</b>Putting all table headings in bold (the default style for the <b>"th"</b>
			element) makes them easier to read. You can also make headings uppercase and then either add a background
			color or an underline to clearly distinguish them from content.
			<b>Shade Alternate Rows</b>Shading every other row can help users follow along the lines. Use a subtle
			distinction from the normal color of the rows to keep the table looking clean
			<b>Align Numerals</b>You can use the text-align property to align the content of any column that contains
			numbers to the right, so that large numbers are clearly distinguished from smaller ones.

	<h2>Floating Elements</h2>
	<h3>The evoluton of the bicycle</h3>
	<blockquote class="blockquote">"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving." <br>-
		Albert Einstein
	</blockquote>
	<p>In 1817 Baron Vos Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster:
		two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame..</p>

	<h2>Using Float To place elements side-by-side</h2>
	<div class="div5">
		<h3>The evolution of the bicycle </h3>
		<p class="p3">Here float is left due to which all these boxes started to settle from the left.</p>
		<p class="p3">Here float is left due to which all these boxes started to settle from the left.</p>

		<p class="p3">Here float is left due to which all these boxes started to settle from the left.</p>
	</div>

	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<h2>Clearing Floats</h2>
	<div class="div6">
		<p class="p4">The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element)
			should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take the following values:</p>
		<p class="p4"><b>Left :-</b> The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing
			in the same containing element.</p>
		<p class="p4"> <b>Right :-</b> The right-hand side of the box will not touch elements appearing in the
			same containing element.</p>
		<p class="p4 clear"> <b>Both :-</b> Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch elements
			appearing in the same containing element.</p>
		<p class="p4"> <b>None :-</b> Elements can touch either side.</p>
		<p class="p4">In this example, the fourth paragraph has a class called clear. The CSS rule for this class
			uses the clear property to indicate that nothing should touch the left-hand side of it. The fourth
			paragraph is therefore moved further down the page so no other element touches its left-hand side.</p>
	</div>

	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	<h2>Parents of floated elements: Problem</h2>
	<div class="div7">
		<p>If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero
			pixels tall but chrome don't. You can use a solution for this which is written in css file as "Parents
			of
			floated elements: Solution" <br>
			As you can see in this example, the one pixel border assigned to the containing element has collapsed,
			so the box looks like a two pixel line.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Creating Multi-Column Layouts with float</h2>

		<h3>Planting Guide</h3>
		<h4>Magnolia</h4>
		<p>Magnolia grandiflora, commonly known as the Southern magnolia or bull bay, is a tree of the family
			Magnoliaceae native to the southeastern United States, from coastal Virginia south to central Florida,
			and west to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. Reaching 27.5 m (90 ft) in height, it is a large striking
			evergreen tree with large dark green leaves and large white fragrant flowers. Widely cultivated around
			the world, over a hundred cultivars have been bred and marketed commercially. The timber is hard and
			heavy, and has been used commercially to make furniture, pallets, and veneer.</p>
		<h4>Ranunculus</h4>
		<p>Ranunculus asiaticus (Persian Buttercup) is a species of buttercup (Ranunculus) native to the eastern
			Mediterranean region in southwestern Asia, southeastern Europe (Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes), and
			northeastern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 45 cm tall, with simple or branched
			stems. The basal leaves are three-lobed, with leaves higher on the stems more deeply divided; like the
			stems, they are downy or hairy. The flowers are 3-5 cm diameter, variably red to pink, yellow, or white,
			with one to several flowers on each stem.</p>
		<h4>Tulip</h4>
		<p>Tulipa gesneriana L. or "Didier's tulip" is a plant belonging to the family of Liliaceae. This species
			has uncertain origins, possibly from Asia, and has become naturalised in south-west Europe. Most of the
			cultivated species, subspecies and cultivars of tulip are derived from Tulipa gesneriana. The flower and
			bulb can cause dermatitis through the allergen, tuliposide A, even though the bulbs may be consumed with
			little ill-effect. The sweet-scented bisexual flowers appear during April and May. Bulbs are extremely
			resistant to frost, and can tolerate temperatures well below freezing - a period of low temperature is
			necessary to induce proper growth and flowering, triggered by an increase in sensitivity to the
			phytohormone auxin. The bulbs may be dried and pulverised and added to cereals or flour.</p>

			northeastern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 45 cm tall, with simple or branched
			stems. The basal leaves are three-lobed, with leaves higher on the stems more deeply divided; like the
			stems, they are downy or hairy. The flowers are 3-5 cm diameter, variably red to pink, yellow, or white,
			with one to several flowers on each stem.</p>
		<h4 class="xlmedium xmdw">Tulip</h4>
		<p>Tulipa gesneriana L. or "Didier's tulip" is a plant belonging to the family of Liliaceae. This
			species
			has uncertain origins, possibly from Asia, and has become naturalised in south-west Europe. Most of the
			cultivated species, subspecies and cultivars of tulip are derived from Tulipa gesneriana. The flower and
			bulb can cause dermatitis through the allergen, tuliposide A, even though the bulbs may be consumed with
			little ill-effect. The sweet-scented bisexual flowers appear during April and May. Bulbs are extremely
			resistant to frost, and can tolerate temperatures well below freezing - a period of low temperature is
			necessary to induce proper growth and flowering, triggered by an increase in sensitivity to the
			phytohormone auxin. The bulbs may be dried and pulverised and added to cereals or flour.</p>

				the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be
				considered as an aside to the article it relates to.
				When the aside element is used outside of an article element, it acts as a container for content that is
				related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of
				recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.

		</ol>
		<h3>KEY MOTIVATIONS</h3>
		<ul>

				something specific (such as a particular fact or information on a product)?</li>
			<li>Are they already familiar with the service or product that you offer or do they need to be introduced to
				it? </li>
			<li>Are they looking for time sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular

				buy it or not? </li>
			<li>Do they need to contact you? If so, can they visit in person (which might require opening hours and a
				map)? Or might they need email or telephone contact details?</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>What yor visitors are trying to achieve?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A person bought a tennis racquet several years ago; now he wants to purchase one from your site for his
				friend.

		<h2>Getting your message across using design</h2>
		<h3>CONTENT</h3>
		<p>Web pages often have a lot of information to communicate for example, the pages of online newspapers will
			have information that does not appear on every page of the prnt equivalent:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A master head or logo</li>
			<li>Links to navigate the site</li>
			<li>Links to related content and other popular articles</li>
			<li>Login or membership options</li>
			<li>Ability for users to comment</li>
			<li>Copyright information</li>
			<li>Links to privacy policies, terms and conditions, advertising information, RSS, feed, subscription
				options</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>PRIORTIZING</h3>
		<p>If everything on a page appeared in the same style, it would be much harder to understand.(Key messages would
			not stand out).</p>
		<p>By making parts of the page look distinct from the surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or way
			from) those items.</p>
		<p>Designers craete something known as the visual hierarchy to help users focus on the key messages that will
			draw people attention, and the guide them to subsequent messages.</p>
		<h3>ORGANIZING</h3>
		<p>Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to
			understand). </p>
		<p>Users should be able to identify the purpose of each block without processing each individual item.
		</p>
		<p>By presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style (such as using the same style for all
			buttons or all links), users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content.

	<h1>Practical Information</h1>
	<h2>SEO(Search Engine Optimization)</h2>
	<h3>On Page Seo</h3>
	<p>There are many way for on page seo some of these are :-</p>
	<p>1. Page Title - The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser. It is
		specified in the "title" element which lives inside the "head" element.</p>
	<p>2. Url - The name of the file is part of the URL. Where possible, use keywords in the file name.</p>
	<p>3. Headings - If the keywords are in a heading "hn" element then a search engine will know that this page is all
		about that subject and give it greater weight than other text.</p>
	<p>4. Text - Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do
		not, however, over-use these terms, because the text must be easy for a human to read.</p>
	<p>5. Link Text - Use keywords in the text that create links between pages (rather than using generic expressions
		such as "click here").</p>
	<p>6. Image Alt - Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images in the alt text. This will
		also help your images show up in the results of image-based searches.</p>
	<p>7. Page Descriptions - The description also lives inside the "head" element and is specified using a "meta" tag.
		It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page. (These are not shown in the browser window but
		they may be displayed in the results pages of search engines.)</p>

	<h2>How identify keywords and phrases</h2>
	<h3>Brainstorm</h3>
	<p>List down the words that someone might type into google to find your sites. Be sure to include the various
		topics, products or services your site is about.</p>
	<p> If often helps to ask other people what words they would use to
		find your site because people less familiar with a topic might use different terms tha you.</p>
	<p>Your list may include some keyword phrases (not just individual words) if you have topics which are described by
		more than one word.</p>
	<h3>Organize</h3>
	<p>Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.</p>
	<p>For example, if your website was a pet shop you might have different categories for different animals (such as
		dogs, cats and rabbits).</p>
	<p>On a large site you may break this up further into sub-categories (for example, separate groups for different pet
		food brands).</p>
	<h3>Research</h3>
	<p>There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might
		like to consider, such as: adwords.google.co.uk/ select/KeywordToolExternal (When using this tool, select the
		"exact match" option rather than "broad match.") www.wordtracker.com www.keyworddiscovery.com</p>
	<p>Once these tools have suggested additional keywords, add the relevant options to your lists. (Keyword tools will
		most likely suggest some terms that are irrelevant so do omit any that do not seem appropriate).</p>
	<h3>Compare</h3>
	<p>It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is
		especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition. The more sites out there that have already been
		optimized for a given keyword, the harder it will be for you to rise up the search results when people search on
		that term.</p>
	<p>Some of the keyword research sites can tell you how many people have searched for a specific keyword to help you
		know how much competition those terms have.</p>
	<p>You can also use Google's advanced search feature to just search the titles of web pages. This will help you to
		determine how many sites have that keyword in the title of their pages. (The more pages with the term in the
		title, the more competition there is.)</p>
	<h3>Refine</h3>
	<p>Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on. These should always be the ones that are most relevant to
		each section of your site.</p>
	<p>If there is a phrase that is very relevant but you find there is a lot of competition, you should still use it.
		To improve the chances of your site being found you can look at whether there are other words that could be
		incorporated into a phrase. For example, if the information or service you offer on your website is location
		specific, then you will often find that incorporating your location into your keyword list will help people find
		you.</p>
	<p>If your site is promoting a slate roofing company in Australia then it is better to get 100 people from Australia
		who are looking for a slate roof than 10,000 from the USA who are looking for other kinds of rooves.</p>
	<h3>Map</h3>
	<p>Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most
		relevant, it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.</p>
	<p>Pick 3-5 keywords or phrases that map to each page of your website and use these as the keywords for each page.
	</p>
	<p>You should not need to repeat the same keywords on all of the pages. It is also likely that, as you move further
		away from the homepage into the sections of the site, the keywords will become more specific to the individual
		topic dealt with on each page.</p>
